IkiWiki::Plugin::jssearchfield - Create a search form to search page field data.

This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/jssearchfield]] directive.  This
enables one to search the structured data ("field" values) of multiple pages.
This uses Javascript for the searching, which means that the entire thing
is self-contained and does not require a server or CGI access, unlike
the default IkiWiki search. This means that it can be used in places such
as ebook readers.  The disadvantage is that because Javascript runs
in the browser, the searching is only as fast as the machine your browser
is running on.

This plugin depends on the [[plugins/contrib/field]] plugin.
