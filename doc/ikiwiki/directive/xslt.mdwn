The `xslt` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/contrib/xslt desc=xslt]] plugin.

This directive processes an input XML data file with XSLT, and outputs the
result in the page where the directive was called.

    \[[!xslt file="data1.xml" stylesheet="style1.xsl"]]

There are two arguments to this directive.

* **file:**
  The file which contains XML data to be processed. This file *must* have a `.xml` extension (`filename.xml`). This file is searched for using the usual IkiWiki mechanism, thus finding the file first in the same directory as the page, then in the directory above, and so on.

* **stylesheet:**
  The file which contains XSLT stylesheet to apply to the XML data.  This file *must* have a `.xsl` extension (`filename.xsl`). This file is searched for using the usual IkiWiki mechanism, thus finding the file first in the same directory as the page, then in the directory above, and so on.

It is expected that the XSLT stylesheet will output valid HTML markup.
